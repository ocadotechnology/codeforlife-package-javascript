## Installing as a symlink

To install this package into a CFL frontend before it's been peer-reviewed and
not have to reinstall it every time you make a change, you can install this
package as a [symlink](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/) by
amending the `dependencies` in the `package.json` of a CFL frontend.

*Remember that the [exports in package.json](package.json#exports) do NOT point
to the source ([src](src/index.ts)) files but rather the distribution
([dist](dist/index.es.js)) files. Therefore, you'll need to rebuild the
distribution files every time you make a change by running `yarn vite build`.*

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "codeforlife": "link:../package"
  }
}
```
